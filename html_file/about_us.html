            <h3>The Nablus Soap Company</h3>
            <p>The most important soap maker in Nablus is the Nablus Soap Company. It was founded in 1971 by Mojtaba Adnan Tbeleh, a descendant from a 400-year tradition of soap makers. All the soaps of the Nablus Soap Company are 100% natural and made by hand.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The family has been well-known for hundreds of years in the sector. That reputation goes so far that the man who cuts the soap into blocks is called ‘Tubeili’, a clear reference to the family.</p>

    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p>The truly vintage making of soap from the Holy Land’s olive oil was the majestic tradition in Nablus city.<br> During the British Mandate, the British Government analysed the soap in the London Institution in 1934,<br> and found that all the ingredients were totally Natural and Chemical-free.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Today there are still a few soap makers active in Nablus, with the most prominent of them being the Nablus Soap Company,<br> which was founded in 1971 by Mojtaba Tbeleh , a descendant from a 400-year tradition of soap makers.<br> The family has been well-known for hundreds of years in this sector.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Their soap has built its own distinct reputation over the centuries.<br> In the 19th century, a peak was experienced when the product was distributed by travelling salesmen far beyond the borders of the Middle East.<br>Bedouins were responsible for the soap reaching the islands of the Mediterranean Sea, from whence it made its way to the Queen of England. From there it did not take long before European women learnt about the nourishing and healing benefits of the soap from Nablus.</p>
